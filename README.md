# Hello!

I'm Christoph Alafair, the founder of Fireca Webtop. 
The repository for Fireca can be found [here](https://github.com/calafair/fireca). Fireca is a web desktop for your computer. It consists of the basic apps, 
such as a calculator, dashboard, news widget, web browser, arcade, etc.

While I'm not coding, I compose songs for the piano, or do homework.<br>
Fireca has recently been migrated to the new [Vercel site](https://fireca.vercel.app), and our team is working on a developer page, so updates will be less frequent
in the next several days.


> ### What's the point?
> Usually, if you have lots of browser tabs or apps <br>open, your computer will slow down, and it<br> might give you a headache just looking at your<br> screen. 
With Fireca, you can cut down on the apps <br>and browser tabs you have, lowering the load on <br>your computer (and yourself).

Here's what Fireca looks like right now (as of Sep 15, 2021):<br>
